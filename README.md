You need to create a DB-based console application from Homework 1 that:
  - connects to the database
  - allows you to perform CRUD (CREATE, READ, UPDATE, DELETE) operations;
  - output to console:
    1) salary (sum) of all developers of a separate project;
    2) a list of developers of a particular project;
    3) list of all Java developers;
    4) list of all middle developers;
    5) a list of projects in the following format: creation date - project name - number of developers on this project.
